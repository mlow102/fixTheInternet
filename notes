Notes on getting the code to work
  Update the port location to be specific to your arduino 
  The app reads the name of the city that has failed from a print beginning with CITY
  The app reads that boston has been connected when MATLAB BOSTON ON has been printed
  The app reads that the reset button has been pushed when MATLAB Reset has been printed
  The app goes back to the home page after idling on the congrats page for a minute
  All the images/videos need to be in the same file as the app to get them to work
